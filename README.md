**A Walk**

This is meant to be a relaxing multiple choice exploration of basic HTML, CSS, and JS capabilities.

Currently it exists as three different pages, [meadow](./meadow), [clouds](./clouds), and [woods](./woods).

Currently I'm just using basic links, images, and text formats plus very basic css inline. Ideally I'd like to expand the styling a bit, add some other pages, and add some sort of JavaScript script to run when a user clicks on the empty links to stay in the same spot.
